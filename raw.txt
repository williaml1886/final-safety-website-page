    Gallery & How to Get Involved
    
          Shown here is a 56-year old male whose info is on display in his computer screen. Not OK!! If you see a screen popping up that asks for your info, such as credit card number, etc. FORGET SIGNING UP!!
          
          Shown here is a protest in Upper Manhattan, New York, stopping racist bullies. These outraged New Yorkers stood up for their bullies. If it's necessary, organize before you start the protest/strike!
            
           The elderlies, shown here, are discussing the issues of segregation & what they are tired of. It's optional if you like to have a discussion meeting with friends or the ones you'd trust the most.
           
           The FBI squad can be pictured trying to get a suspect out of their house. Watch out, because once you type a deadly phrase or word or 2, you're NEXT!!!</p>
          </div>

          Pictured here is an inmate having his/her last moment(s) while awaiting for execution day. Be warned, your words matter in serious ways. Once you screw up, your consequence(s) = how you'll meet your destiny, or how your life will end as.
          
            Pictured here is a load of outraged citizens who are against scams/scandals. Once you reveal your crime secret, it's on you. Outraged mobs of people will hate you & call you many kinds of words or phrases, etc.
